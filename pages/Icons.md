# Icons
Icons are visual images that carry the expression of activities and themes. Icons can be utilized to draw the user's desired information or outcome. Utilizing icon can also move forward the perception and grouping of immense content. Business Finland theme incorporates both user interface machines and outline machines. 

#### Principles

An icon should continuously serve a clear, easily understandable purpose. **Icons should not be used solely for decoration.**

An icon should ideally go along with a text label to give context for interpretation. The meaning of icons by them self can be vague and alter depending on the context. Label can be excluded only if the meaning of the icon is commonly established, or can be easily interpreted from the context, e.g. volume buttons in video playback.
An icon and its related content or label should have the same meaning. Clashing and uncertain interpretations can have a negative impact on usability and accessibility.

- An icon should continuously serve a recognizable, easily understandable purpose. Icons should not be used exclusively for decoration.
- An icon should ideally be followed with a text label to give context for interpretation. The meaning of icons by them self can be vague and alter depending on the context. Label can be excluded only if the meaning of the icon is commonly known, or can be easily interpreted from the context, e.g. volume buttons in video playback.
- An icon and its related content or label should have the same meaning. Clashing and uncertain interpretations can have a negative impact on usability and accessibility


#### Accessibility
- For icons that do not have a visual content name but are vital must be given a text alternative using the WAI-ARIA definition aria-label or aria-labelledby. See [WCAG 2.1 Text Alternatives guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives) for more information.
- In case the icon includes a visual text label associated with it, the icon can be hidden from assistive technologies with aria-hidden="true". It prevents screenreaders repeating the same information twice (visual text followed by the icon description).
- If the icon is only decorative, it should consistently be hidden from assistive technologies with aria-hidden="true".
The colour contrast between the icon and its background must follow with [AA Level contrast ratios.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum)


#### Size and Use
If icons are used in coexistence with text, the size of the text determines the size of the icon.
