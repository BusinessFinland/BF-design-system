# Icons
Icons are visual symbols that support the expression of actions and topics. Icons can be used to draw the user's attention to the desired information or function. Using icons can also improve the perception and grouping of extensive content. Business Finland theme includes both user interface machines and illustration machines.

#### Principles

An icon should always serve a distinct, easily understandable purpose. **Icons should not be used solely for decoration.**

An icon should preferably be accompanied with a text label to give context for interpretation. The meaning of icons by them self can be ambiguous and change depending on the context. Label can be omitted only if the meaning of the icon is commonly established, or can be easily interpreted from the context, e.g. volume buttons in video playback.
An icon and its related content or label should have the same meaning. Conflicting and ambivalent interpretations can have a negative effect on usability and accessibility.

#### Accessibility
- For icons that do not have a visual text label but are important must be given a text alternative using the WAI-ARIA definition aria-label or aria-labelledby. See [WCAG 2.1 Text Alternatives guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives) for more information.
- If the icon has a visual text label associated with it, the icon can be hidden from assistive technologies with aria-hidden="true". It prevents screenreaders repeating the same information twice (visual text followed by the icon description).
- If the icon is only decorative, it should always be hidden from assistive technologies with aria-hidden="true".
The colour contrast between the icon and its background must comply with [AA Level contrast ratios.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum)


#### Size and Use
If icons are used in conjunction with text, the size of the text determines the size of the icon.
